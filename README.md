senchatouch2-xml-to-map
=======================

This basic application developed in sencha demonstrates a Map application that can consume with XML data (From rest API, or static XML) and plot them to the MAP. It also has geocoding capabilities , but the capabilities are commented out (Line 30 in app.js) for the sake of making the plot of the points on the map visible to the user of the application. 

The motivation is to learn the workings of Sencha and get into a bit of advanced coding using the same.

To use the code, just install a web server (if you dont have one running ) and copy the folder to the root of the server and then access the folder via browser. You should see the Application up and running in the browser. The code is dirty and has bugs because it is created just for learning purposes only . The view is not coded and the output is thrown to the console of the browser.

Used Technologies : 1. Sencha CMD 2. Secnha Touch framework 3. Wamp server 4. Sublime text editor 5. Win 8.1 Pro x64
