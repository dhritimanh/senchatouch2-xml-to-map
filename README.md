senchatouch2-xml-to-map
=======================

This basic application developed in sencha demonstrates a Map application that can consume with XML data (From rest API, or static XML) and plot them to the MAP. It also has geocoding capabilities , but the capabilities are commented out (Line 30 in app.js) for the sake of making the plot of the points on the map visible to the user of the application.
